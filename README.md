The Learning Curve of a NEWbie
Its is actually challenging to experience a totally new field, but then some people make it worth learning and some people just go with the robotic flow of teaching
I have really made some people dissapointed by making them teach me the same stuff again and again but for sure i will make it and wont quit so soon...thanks to such good souls !!
I've been learning new things but its a slow progress and hope so people understand it.
