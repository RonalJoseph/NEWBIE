The Learning Curve of a NEWbie
Its is actually challenging to experience a totally new field, but then some people make it worth learning and some people just go with the robotic flow of teaching,
I have really dissapointed many by making them teach me the same stuff again and again but for sure i will learn it and mention their hardwork towards me ...thanks to such good souls !!
I've been learning new things but its a slow progress and hope so people understand it but one things for sure i wont give up !!
